# Image_Processing_basic
Basic image processing techniques, like- histogram equalization, interpolation, rgb to greyscale, image negative, image arithmetic etc.- on MatLab.

The code written in Matlab and all the basic image processing techniques have been combined in one file with different sections.<br/>
Two images have ben taken into consideration for better clarity of concepts.<br/>

## `Section 1` 
This secton has operations to `Resize` the image, `Add, Subtract, Multiply and Divide` the image with constants and with each other.

## `Section 2`
This section focuses on `Histogram Equalization`

## `Section 3`
This section focuses on `RGB to GREYSCALE conversion`

## `Section 4`
This section focuses on `Gamma Correction`

## `Section 5`
This section focuses on `Image Negative`

## `Section 6`
This section focuses on `Image Interpolation` like Rotation, Flip, Shear etc.

### Basic system requirements-
MataLab software
